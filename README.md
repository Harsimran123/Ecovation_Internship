**Statistical Arbitrage** 
For a family of stocks, generally belonging to the same sector or industry, there exists a correlation between prices of each of the stocks. There, though, exist anomalous times when for a small period of time, the correlation is broken. But the market self corrects in some time and the correlation is re-established. During this small window of time when correlation is anomalous, there exists a money-making opportunity for quantitative traders.

Here is the equity data of stocks listed on NSE over 2016 and 2017: **Dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kyNXxSM-_MSW4kSUJ90HlPQaxPCVti5L/view)**

I did time series analysis to seperate 2016 & 2017 reports as Training and Testing data respectively.

Then did regression with LinearRegression model.

The prediction graph over 2017 is plotted with an accuracy of 99.2%
